/**
 * Sim Week scenario data — the two bill lifecycles as pure data.
 *
 * See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-27-sim-week-design.md.
 *
 * Every status line below has been validated against the real deterministic
 * classifier (server/services/statusClassifier.js) so that the cumulative log
 * up to each sim-day resolves to the intended kanban stage. Do NOT reword a
 * line without re-running server/tests/simEngine.test.js — the wording is
 * load-bearing (it must match docs/bill-status-pattern-table.md).
 *
 * A "step" is one sim-day (1..5). Each step contributes zero or more status
 * lines to the bill's cumulative log. Lines are authored oldest->newest here;
 * the engine reverses to newest-first before handing to the classifier.
 *
 * `requiredAction` marks a checkpoint that user-driven bills must satisfy:
 *   - 'contact'  : bill is waiting; a contact flag advances it (else it dies).
 *   - 'testify'  : bill is at a hearing; a support testimony passes it,
 *                  an oppose testimony (or none) defers/kills it.
 * Auto bills ignore requiredAction and always take the advancing line(s).
 *
 * When a user-driven bill fails a checkpoint, the engine replaces that day's
 * advancing line with a `deathLine` (a permanent committee deferral that
 * dead-bill.js recognizes) and injects nothing further.
